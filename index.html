                    <p>I am an editor that works in educational publishing at Macmillan Learning here in NYC. I live in West Chelsea with my wife Meredith, who I met when we were both undergraduates at the University of Chicago. (At the time, we were both secretly aspiring writers&#8211and still are!) I've lived in NYC for nearly two years, after living in South Florida about nearly three years. I'm originally from Newburyport, MA.  
                    </p>
                    <p>I've worked in publishing, in some form or another, for over fifteen years,going back to when I started a school newspaper with two of my classmates back in high school. I consider myself a bibliophile <em>and</em> a technophile! Call it media pluralism. I believe our media diet should be as intentional as our food diet. Speaking of diet, I am a vegan, who loves coffee in the morning and drinking wine in the eventing&#8211especially around a campfire, in Central Park, or at my favorite wine spot Terroir in Tribeca.
